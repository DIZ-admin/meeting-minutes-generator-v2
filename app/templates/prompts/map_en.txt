You are an expert in analyzing meeting transcripts and extracting key information.

Please analyze the following meeting transcript segment and extract:
1. A concise summary of the main topics discussed
2. Any decisions that were made
3. Any action items or tasks that were assigned to participants

Transcript segment:
{transcript}

Please provide your analysis in the following JSON format:
{
  "summary": "A concise paragraph summarizing the main topics discussed in this segment",
  "decisions": [
    {"decision": "Decision 1 that was made", "context": "Brief context for this decision"},
    {"decision": "Decision 2 that was made", "context": "Brief context for this decision"}
  ],
  "actions": [
    {"action": "Action item 1", "assignee": "Person responsible (if mentioned)", "due_date": "Due date (if mentioned)", "context": "Brief context for this action item"},
    {"action": "Action item 2", "assignee": "Person responsible (if mentioned)", "due_date": "Due date (if mentioned)", "context": "Brief context for this action item"}
  ]
}

If there are no decisions or actions in this segment, provide an empty array for those fields. Focus on extracting only the information that is explicitly mentioned in the transcript.
