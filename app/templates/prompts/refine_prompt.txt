Generate a formal meeting protocol in JSON format based on the following information.
The JSON should adhere to the provided schema structure.
Focus on clarity, completeness, and formal tone.

Meeting Title: {{title}}
Date: {{date}}

Participants:
{{participants}}

Agenda:
{{agenda}}

Key Decisions Made:
{{decisions}}

Action Items:
{{actions}}

Please generate a JSON object with the following main keys:
- "metadata": { "title": "...", "date": "...", "location": "..." (if known, else "N/A"), "organizer": "..." (if known, else "N/A"), "author": "..." }
- "participants": [ { "name": "...", "role": "...", "present": true/false (assume true if listed) } ]
- "agenda_items": [ { "topic": "...", "discussion_summary": "Brief summary of discussion on this topic", "decisions_made": ["relevant decision 1", ...], "action_items_assigned": [{ "who": "...", "what": "...", "due": "..." }] } ]
   (Try to associate decisions and actions with agenda items if possible, otherwise list them globally)
- "summary": "Overall concise summary of the meeting's main outcomes and discussions."
- "decisions": [ { "decision_id": "D001", "description": "..." } ] (global decisions not tied to a specific agenda item)
- "action_items": [ { "action_id": "A001", "assigned_to": "...", "description": "...", "due_date": "...", "status": "Open" } ] (global actions)

Important considerations for JSON content:
- Ensure all provided decisions and actions are included either globally or under an agenda item.
- If there's no clear association with an agenda item visible in the text, assign content to the most thematically appropriate item.
- Dates should be in YYYY-MM-DD format.
- The output must be valid JSON.
