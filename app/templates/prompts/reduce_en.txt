You are an expert in analyzing meeting transcripts and consolidating information.

I have analyzed different segments of a meeting transcript and extracted summaries, decisions, and action items from each segment. Now I need you to consolidate this information into a cohesive overview of the entire meeting.

Please review the following analysis results from different segments of the meeting and create a consolidated view:

{map_results}

Please provide a consolidated analysis in the following JSON format:
{
  "summary": "A comprehensive summary of the entire meeting, covering all major topics discussed",
  "decisions": [
    {"decision": "Decision 1 that was made", "context": "Brief context for this decision"},
    {"decision": "Decision 2 that was made", "context": "Brief context for this decision"}
  ],
  "actions": [
    {"action": "Action item 1", "assignee": "Person responsible (if mentioned)", "due_date": "Due date (if mentioned)", "context": "Brief context for this action item"},
    {"action": "Action item 2", "assignee": "Person responsible (if mentioned)", "due_date": "Due date (if mentioned)", "context": "Brief context for this action item"}
  ]
}

Important guidelines:
1. Eliminate duplicate decisions and actions (those that refer to the same thing)
2. Combine related information from different segments
3. Ensure the summary provides a complete overview of the entire meeting
4. Include all unique decisions and action items
5. Maintain the original meaning and context of each item
