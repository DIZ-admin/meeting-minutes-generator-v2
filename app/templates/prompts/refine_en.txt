You are an expert in creating detailed and well-structured meeting protocols.

I have analyzed a meeting transcript and extracted the key information. Now I need you to create a formal meeting protocol based on this analysis and the provided meeting information.

Meeting Information:
{meeting_info}

Analysis Results:
{reduced_data}

Please create a comprehensive meeting protocol in JSON format that follows this structure:
{
  "metadata": {
    "title": "Meeting title",
    "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "location": "Meeting location",
    "participants": ["Participant 1", "Participant 2", ...],
    "organizer": "Meeting organizer",
    "agenda": ["Agenda item 1", "Agenda item 2", ...]
  },
  "summary": "A comprehensive executive summary of the meeting",
  "discussion_points": [
    {
      "topic": "Topic 1",
      "details": "Detailed discussion about Topic 1"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Topic 2",
      "details": "Detailed discussion about Topic 2"
    }
  ],
  "decisions": [
    {
      "decision": "Decision 1",
      "context": "Context for Decision 1"
    },
    {
      "decision": "Decision 2",
      "context": "Context for Decision 2"
    }
  ],
  "action_items": [
    {
      "action": "Action item 1",
      "assignee": "Person responsible",
      "due_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "context": "Context for Action item 1"
    },
    {
      "action": "Action item 2",
      "assignee": "Person responsible",
      "due_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "context": "Context for Action item 2"
    }
  ],
  "next_meeting": {
    "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "time": "HH:MM",
    "location": "Location for next meeting",
    "agenda_items": ["Agenda item 1 for next meeting", "Agenda item 2 for next meeting"]
  }
}

Guidelines:
1. Use the provided meeting information for the metadata section
2. Create discussion_points based on the summary from the analysis
3. Include all decisions and action items from the analysis
4. If information about the next meeting is not available, use null for the next_meeting field
5. Ensure the protocol is professional, clear, and well-structured
